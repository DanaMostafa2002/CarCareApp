Factory Method Pattern: This pattern can be used to create instances of vehicles, workers, and services. It provides a way to encapsulate the object creation logic and allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. For example, you can have a VehicleFactory, WorkerFactory, and ServiceFactory that create different types of vehicles, workers, and services based on their specific requirements.

Singleton Pattern: This pattern can be applied to the CarCareApplication class to ensure that there is only one instance of the application throughout its lifecycle. This can be useful for centralizing the management of vehicles, workers, and services and providing a single point of access to these resources.

Observer Pattern: This pattern can be used to notify the application or other interested objects when a vehicle is cleaned out or when there are changes in the availability of workers. The CleanOut function can notify the application or other components that need to be informed of the completion of the cleaning process.

Strategy Pattern: This pattern can be used to implement different allocation strategies for assigning workers to cars during the clean-in function. You can define an interface called AllocationStrategy with methods like allocateWorker and have different implementations for the two configurations: FirstComeFirstServedStrategy and SpecialPassengersFitStrategy. The CarCareApplication class can have a reference to the AllocationStrategy interface and dynamically switch between the strategies based on the configuration.

Decorator Pattern: This pattern can be applied to the Service class to add offers for doing specific services together. You can define a base Service class and then create decorators that add additional functionalities or modify the behavior of the base service. For example, you can have a CarCleaningService as the base service and decorators like OilChangeService and TireChangeService that add the functionality of changing car oil and tires, respectively.
